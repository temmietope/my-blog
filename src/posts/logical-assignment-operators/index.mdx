Logical Assignment Operators was introduced in the ECMAScript 2021 update. It is a new feature that combines the assignment operators with the logical operators (||, &&, ??). It that allows you to assign a value to a variable if true (`&&=`), false (`||=`) or null (`??=`).

## Types of Logical Assignment Operators

- Logical OR assignment operator ||=
- Logical AND assignment operator &&=
- Nullish coalescing assignment operator ??=

### Logical OR assignment operator ||=

This accessor is used to assign a value to a variable if the variable is not already assigned. If the variable is already assigned, the value is not changed.

```javascript
//Syntax
a ||= b
```

This syntax is also similar to:

```javascript
if (!a) {
  a = b
}
```

An example is

```javascript
let a = 0
a ||= 1
console.log(a) // 1
```

The above example assigns the value `1` to the variable `a` if the variable is not already assigned. If the variable is already assigned, the value is not changed.

### Logical AND assignment operator &&=

This is used to assign a value to a variable only if the value is a truthy

```javascript
// Syntax
a &&= b
```

This syntax is also similar to:

```javascript
if (a) {
  a = b
}
```

An example is

```javascript
let a = 0
a &&= 1
console.log(a) // 0
```

In the above example, a is a falsy value, so it will not be reassigned. It will only reassign if the value is truthy.

```javascript
let a = 4
a &&= 1
console.log(a) // 1
```

### Nullish coalescing assignment operator ??=

This is similar to the Logical OR assignment operator ||=, however, it only reassigns if the left operand is **null** or **undefined**.

```javascript
// Syntax
a ??= b
```

This syntax is also similar to:

```javascript
if (typeof a === "undefined" || a === null) {
  a = b
}
```

```javascript
let a = 0
a ??= 1
console.log(a) // 0

let b = null
b ??= 1
console.log(b) // 1
```
